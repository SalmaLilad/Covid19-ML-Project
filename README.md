###  Project Overview
This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The goal of this project is to develop a binary image classifier that distinguishes **COVID-positive** vs. **non-COVID** chest X-rays. Using a dataset provided by the **University of Minnesota‚Äôs MCFAM**, the model performs **binary classification** between COVID-positive and non-COVID cases.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was used for feature extraction, batch normalization for stability, and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.  CNN 

This project was completed as part of my **Machine Learning repository** to apply the techniques I learned in the 2025 Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Summer Camp at the University of Minnesota
This repository contains my end-to-end machine learning project that classifies chest X-ray images to detect COVID-19 infection. The project was inspired by real-world clinical challenges and uses an open dataset from the **University of Minnesota MCFAM Lab**, with PyTorch as the primary framework.
